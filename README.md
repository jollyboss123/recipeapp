# recipeapp

Function:
For users to note down personal recipes. Recipes are categorised according to different cuisines. New cuisine types can be created.

Bugs:
1. autocomplete in createnewrecipe page does not respond to other alphabets besides 'c'
2. some buttons are spammable
3. add image function does not appear in update recipe mode in createnewrecipe page

Ideas:
1. add gesture detection for bottomsheetfragment in createnewrecipe page
2. better animation transition when changing in between categories in home fragment
